# alpha-beta_pruning
Alpha-Beta pruning in python. This is usful for implementing a "computer" in games by allowing the computer to look ahead a certian number of moves. The term "min maxing" refers to the idea of finding the best possible solution. 
Each "move" ahead in the graph alternates between min and max. We want to maximize our chances of wining and minimize the chance of a player winning if used in a game.
